    > The deployment process will take approximately 15 minutes. You must wait for the deployment to finish. You can safely ignore the **deployMSSentinel2Go** Conflict error message. If you receive any conflict errors during the deployment, you'll likely receive an error that the deployment failed. You can safely ignore the error as it isn't related to the resources used in the lab.
