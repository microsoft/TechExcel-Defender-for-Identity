# Task 3.1: Suspicious additions to sensitive groups

Attackers could add users to highly privileged groups to gain access to more resources, and gain persistence. This alert needs a machine learning period (such as: this user usually doesn't perform this addition to sensitive groups).

1. On the **DC01 RDP session**, open a PowerShell window, and run the following command:

    ```PowerShell-wrap
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members RonHD
    ```
