# Task 2.1: User and IP address reconnaissance (SMB)

In this detection, an alert is triggered when an SMB session enumeration is performed against a domain controller. 

Users and computers need to at least access the SYSVOL share to retrieve GPOs. Attackers can use this information 
to know where users recently signed in and move laterally in the network to get to a specific sensitive account.

Tools used in this test: **[https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/)**.

1. Open a new RDP session to WIN5 using the **WIN5.rdp** file in the Downloads folder and then select **More choices/Use a different account** to sign in using **MSMDI\JeffL** using the password **Passw0rd12!@**

1. In the Windows search field, enter **CMD** and then open a Command Prompt.

1. Run the following command:

    ```CMD-wrap
    c:\Tools\Netsess\NetSess.exe DC01
    ```

    {: .warning }
    > You can safely ignore any errors that appear when running the command.
