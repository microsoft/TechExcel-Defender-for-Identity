# Task 6.2: Remote code execution attempts

Defender for Identity detects PSexec, Remote WMI, and PowerShell connections from a client machine to a domain controller. Attackers can run remote commands on your domain controller or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server to create persistence, collect data or perform a denial of service (DOS).

Tools used in this test: Sysinternals downloads

    ```PowerShell-wrap
