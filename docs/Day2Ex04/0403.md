# Task 4.3: Honeytoken activity

A honeytoken account should be attractive for attackers, using an attractive name or a sensitive group membership, and should be left unused by your organization. Any activity from a honeytoken account might indicate malicious behavior, such as LDAP, NTLM or Kerberos sign-in attempts.

To configure an account as a honeytoken, make sure to tag it accordingly. For more information, review [Defender for Identity entity tags in Microsoft Defender XDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/entity-tags "Defender for Identity entity tags in Microsoft Defender XDR").
