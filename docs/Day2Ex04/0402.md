# Task 4.2: Suspected DCSync attack (replication of directory services)

If attackers have the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All permission, they can initiate a replication request to retrieve the data stored in Active Directory, such as the krbtgt's password hash.

In this detection, an alert is triggered when a replication request is initiated from a computer that isn't a domain controller.

Tools used in this test: **[https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases)**.

1. In the WIN5 RDP session, sign in as MSMDI\JeffL.

1. In a Command window, run:

    ```CMD-wrap
    c:\Tools\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimikatz.exe "lsadump::dcsync /domain:MSMDI.local /user:krbtgt" "exit"
    ```

    {: .warning }
    > You can safely ignore any errors that appear when running the commands.

This will retrieve the krbtgt's password hash and move to a golden ticket attack.
